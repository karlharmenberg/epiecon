# epiecon

Code by Karl Harmenberg and Jonna Olsson. Work in progress.

See above for a Julia/Pluto notebook where you can play around with the parameters of an epi-econ model. Just move the sliders for the various parameters and see how the evolution of the epidemic changes.

If you don't feel like installing Julia, you can play around with the model in your browser. Just [click here](https://binder.plutojl.org/v0.19.12/open?url=https%253A%252F%252Fraw.githubusercontent.com%252Fkarlharmenberg%252Fepiecon%252Fmain%252Fnotebook_simple_epiecon.jl) and wait a few minutes. The link takes you to a "binder" with the notebook. It takes a few minutes since first the environment needs to be initialized and then the code needs to be compiled. The code is ready to play around with once there are graphs at the bottom of the notebook.
